NSCA is the remote passive acceptance daemon used with many Nagios installs. It
ships with a (C-language) executable called send_nsca for submitting checks.
This is a mostly-clean re-implementation of send_nsca in pure-python. It
supports 10 of the 26 crypto functions used by upstream NSCA, sending to
multiple hosts with one invocation, and timeouts.
